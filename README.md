Welcome to my GitHub page!

The purpose of this page is to show my creative project for the FALL 2025 UAC Trailblazer Scholarship.

The project shows what my life would be like when I become 40.
Starting from my childhood, I wanted to show my life timeline as a game-looking website and add fun by recording memorable moments in my life.
I've also added some future moments that I am dreaming of, such as doing my internship at Epic Games or becoming a Riot Games TFT Project Manager.
I hope this website provides interesting experiences to other people and conveys my message of how my life would be within 20 years.
